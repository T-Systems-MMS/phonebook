      If an error occurs while the application is running, an anonymous error report is
      automatically generated. In exceptional cases - since this is a preview - the following
      personal data can still be found in one of the reports:
    </p>
    <mat-list>
      <mat-list-item>
        Username (short and full name)
      </mat-list-item>
      <mat-list-item>
        Bookmarks and Last seen people
      </mat-list-item>
      <mat-list-item>
        The Last 20 Actions performed in the app
      </mat-list-item>
    </mat-list>
    <p>
      The data from the error report is used exclusively for the purpose of analysis and correction
      of the error by our core development team. The data will not be passed on to third parties.
    </p>

        >TL;DR With your permission, you agree that bug reports that may contain your personal data
        can be sent to our core development team and be used for error analysis and resolution.
