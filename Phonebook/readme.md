# Phonebook Application

The Deployment Guide for the Phonebook.
We use [traefik](https://traefik.io/) under the hood. 

## Deployment

### Installation

> Please make sure you have a running Kubernetes Cluster, with Tiller and Helm installed.

1. Create your `values.yml`. For settings look [here](#Settings).

    ```yml
    # Minimal Working Example
    host: &host 'example.com'
    contactUrl: '<Your Contact Url, maybe an issue tracker?>'
    roomPlanningToolUrl: '<Url to your Room Planning Tool>'
    contactEmail: &contactEmail '<Your Contact Email>'
    employeePictureEndpoint: '<Url To you User Picture Endpoint>'
    assetsEndpoint: '<Url To you User Assets Endpoint>'
    ```

    For a more complete Example have a look at our demo [values.yml](../Phonebook.Demo/values.yml).

2. Install your Phonebook application by running `helm install --values ./path/to/your/values.yml https://github.com/T-Systems-MMS/phonebook/releases/download/<latest release>/phonebook.tgz`
