### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing to Phonebook? You can start by looking for
the
["good-first-issue"-label](https://github.com/T-Systems-MMS/phonebook/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
If you have questions about the issue or do not know where to start you can just
ask under the issue.

### Open Pull Requests

If you want to open a pull request please use our [template](will be added
soon). Please also note the issue which get resolved and stuff the reviewers
need to know before reviewing your code.

## What should I know before I get started?

Before you start contributing be sure that you have already taken a look at our
[Documentation](https://t-systems-mms.github.io/phonebook/). There you can find
all things you need to know before work with the project.

### Mandatory stuff

To provide good code quality we are using prettier to format all files the same
way. Just make sure that you are using the Plugin
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in your IDE. You can find our settings
[here](https://prettier.io/).

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

Because of we are using
[semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) it is
important that the git messages, especially the merge messages, follow the
[Angular commit Message Convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).
The messages should have the following format: `type(scope): subject`

- _type_ -> feat, fix, chore and docs\
- _scope_ -> The part of the program which will be affected \
- _subject_ -> Description of what has been changed\
