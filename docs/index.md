## **:question: What is the Phonebook?**

The Phonebook is a community project for us, from us and everybody is welcome to participate.
This Single-Page-Application is able to display People, Rooms and the organization structure. It is also perfect to search for people in a company, get information where they sit in your building and how to contact them.

## **:electric_plug: Technologie overview**
The project makes use of the following noteworthy frameworks:

<details>
<summary>Frontend Frameworks</summary>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>: The popular JavaScript framework is the base of this application. We also use the Angular routing for navigation to different views.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/" target="_blank">Angular CLI</a>:  Makes development and the build process of the application much easier. It encapsulates the Webpack build configuration and provides some reasonable conventions to follow instead. The CLI also provides some convenient commands to generate new components, services, etc.</li>
  <li><a href="https://material.angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular Material</a>: Provides components to build an application with Google's Material design. We use it as a basis for our graphical layout.</li>
</ul>
