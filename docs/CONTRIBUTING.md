### Reviewing a pull request

## What should I know before I get started?
Before you start contributing be sure that you have already taken a look at our [Documentation](https://t-systems-mms.github.io/phonebook/). There you can find all things you need to know before work with the project.

### Mandatory stuff
To provide good code quality we are using prettier to format all files the same way. Just make sure that you are using the Plugin [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) in your IDE. You can find our settings [here](https://prettier.io/).

## Styleguides
### Git Commit Messages
Because of we are using [semantic release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) it is important that the git messages, especially the merge messages, follow the [Angular commit Message Convention](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#-git-commit-guidelines).
The messages should have the following format: `type(scope): subject`

> *type* -> feat, fix, chore and docs\
> *scope* -> The part of the program which will be affected \
> *subject* -> Description of what has been changed\
